Today, when a developer is tasked with fixing a bug, they use the editor to identify the right part of the code, read some documentation, author the changes, test it in some real environment and put it up for review. That's how it's done today, by hopping around in this editor.

And the only tiny piece of this in which AI has become effective lately is authoring the code. But all the other parts are still untouched.

Our goal is to chip away and add AI to all parts of the developer workflow to offer a significantly more productive experience, and we believe that to do it right, we have to own the editor. That's what we are building at CodeStory.

You have full control over each step of the loop, but you can also create (or attempt to create) a Magic Loop by simply describing what you want.

28417,Yuma,ChatGPT for customer support,"## What is Yuma?

Yuma is using LLMs to automate customer support. We integrate directly with help desk software and focus on helping large Shopify merchants deal with their high volume of support requests.
 
## Why do Shopify merchants need Yuma?

There are thousands of Shopify merchants around the world generating $10M+ a year. Most of them have taken over some niches and are great at what they do: selling their products.

But they all have one thing in common: they all hate customer support. It's a burden for them and a huge source of cost, as they receive hundreds of requests per day. Some of them have dozens of support agents on staff, usually offshore, and the overall quality is still often pretty poor while staff turnover remains high.

Those merchants have been promised automation for years but have always been disappointed by the outcome. As customers, we have all had to live through a terrible support automation experience before, so this is no secret, and everyone knows that the current state of the technology is quite bad.

## Yuma is solving this in a few ways:

First and most importantly, we believe that the recent advances in AI technology finally make solving this problem achievable.

By coupling LLMs with custom-built knowledge bases, Yuma is able to suggest drafts that are relevant and customized to the support agents. With a one-click install, Yuma can natively integrate with any help desk software without disrupting current workflows, but only augmenting them.

By using LLMs to analyze historical tickets, Yuma can mimic the writing style of a brand, but also learn and replicate current workflows without any configuration needed, bringing the setup and adoption cost to almost zero.

Yuma also offers the ability to build a new kind of smart and dynamic workflows that were not possible before, with a plain English description of a given scenario.

Finally, LLMs also make working with multiple languages a breeze. The agents can focus their work on a single language, knowing that their output will always be appropriate and grammatically correct.

## Fun Fact

Yuma got started by accident. This is my third YC startup after Socialcam (W12) and Triplebyte (S15).

As companies grow, they spend a lot on DevOps or Platform Engineers that try to reduce the burden on developers by gluing together all the 3p tools via custom internal tools.

We are building an “internal developer platform” out of the box, with best practices and golden paths for building and operating services on Kubernetes.

We do the research on the latest and greatest tools in the extremely vibrant ecosystem, and automatically integrate for you the tools you want to use.

A little more detail to understand our scientific approach: A normal cell turns into cancer when it develops a mutation that makes it grow aggressively. Surprisingly, a small number of these mutations account for the vast majority of cancer deaths. The immune system usually doesn’t recognize these mutations, but our technology platform enables us to train the immune system to recognize and attack these cancers. Our first product is a vaccine for the treatment of lung cancer that targets the KRAS mutation, the most common mutation in cancer, accounting for about 30% of all cancer deaths. In the long run, we envision a world where every adult receives our vaccines annually – preventing the majority of cancer deaths. 

Our team includes some of the leading cancer vaccine experts in the world including: our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Liz Jaffee (Chair of President Biden’s Cancer Advisory Panel) and our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Mark Yarchoan (principal investigator of multiple cancer vaccine clinical trials).

“You Have Arrived At Your Destination!” — or so Google Maps thinks. In reality, the way couriers navigate is broken: No parking, hard-to-find entrances, and labyrinth-like apartment and office complexes can turn the last meters of delivery into a time-consuming puzzle.

truemetrics provides parking positions and entrance locations to enable faster drop-offs. Our data is generated by analyzing sensor data from drivers' smartphones, allowing truemetrics to identify precise parking and entrance locations, thereby simplifying the last meters of delivery.

India is a nation of savers but the way the majority of India saves is non-smart & does not create wealth. There are 200 Mn Indians who save manually in bank deposits, the returns from these instruments do not even beat India's inflation. 

Gold is an instrument that India loves - 30Bn worth gold is purchased in India every year by middle income households. Gold has great cultural significance in India & there is high familiarity with the asset class. Despite gold being a familiar asset class & giving 5% higher returns than bank deposits, 200 Mn Indians still save manually in these non wealth creating bank deposits. This is largely because the ways to save in Gold required painful discrete activities such as manually accumulating money to buy gold, going to offline stores to buy this gold, incurring storage charges & more. The minimum ticket size for purchasing gold at these stores is $50 adding to more friction to saving in Gold.

Using automated savings, Gullak now makes it extremely easy for users to save small amounts regularly($1/day) in digital Gold.This was not possible a year ago because the underlying infrastructure(UPI Autopay) was missing. 

With 50 Mn Indians saving $2/day & with gold backed lending, this is a $1.5Bn market opportunity.

Whether you’re in Antigua or Australia, Saipan or Sumatra, goods can take days or weeks to come by boat the cheap way. If you need pharmaceuticals, fresh produce, or electronics quickly, expect to pay 10x or 20x in shipping costs to have it flown. Electric aircraft could be a solution for lowering cost, but we’re stuck with small payloads and low range for many years to come. So for the hundreds of millions of people around the world in coastal or inter-island communities that could benefit the most, the electric aviation revolution just isn’t coming. Unless...

Without requiring FAA certification or integration into formal airspace, Seaflight’s simple uncrewed ""ground effect"" craft will enable high value, time-sensitive cargo to be flown overwater, point-to-point between coastal communities at 10x the speed of a ship, with triple the margin of conventional air freight, and almost double the range or payload of a conventional electric aircraft. Express air cargo continues to grow at double digit pace, it's time to deliver it in the most efficient way possible for cost and climate.

26769,ALT TEX,"Biodegradable and carbon neutral textiles, engineered from food waste.","ALT TEX is a Toronto-based biomaterials startup that has developed the world’s first biodegradable and carbon neutral fabric, engineered from the world’s largest landfill contributor - food waste. Polyester alone makes up 60% of the $2.5 trillion fashion industry and is the biggest blocker preventing brands from meeting sustainability mandates. The patent-pending ALT TEX fermentation technology creates a polyester alternative that works with the existing infrastructure to supply a sustainable, high performance and cost competitive polyester replacement to fashion brands, at scale. 

The product solves key problems for fashion brands, consumers, and the environment:

(1) Fashion brands: ALT TEX sells fabric to fashion brands, allowing them to differentiate via sustainable options (sustainable fashion growing 11% CAGR) and hit sustainability targets, without sacrificing performance or changing their current supply chain.

(2) Consumer: The ALT TEX fabric is projected to be half the price vs. other specialized sustainable alternatives (due to low-cost input and scalability), meaning greater accessibility.

(3) Environment: A single shirt produced with ALT TEX fabric can divert 1 kg of food waste from landfills, 9 kg of carbon emissions from the air, and 4 g of micro-plastics from our waterways.

Co-founders Myra and Avneet have worked together managing teams and projects for six years, with backgrounds in serial entrepreneurship, corporate sales at Fortune 500 companies, textile manufacturing and biochemistry. To date, ALT TEX has created their first fabric prototype that’s 70% stronger than cotton, secured $1M in LOIs and raised $2.3M.",S22,Active,Carbon Capture and Removal,Bioplastic,Biotech,Climate,"Toronto, Canada",CA,2020,2,Myra Arshad,Avneet Ghotra,10,https://thealttex.com/,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/alt-tex/,Food Tech,,,,,

Merchants, service providers and subscriptions-based businesses everywhere now offer their customers the ability to save a debit/credit card on file, so they can pay their bills on time, buy in one click, or earn rewards. In 2021, 79% of consumers worldwide reported already having at least one payment card saved with a service or being open to doing so. 

In recent years, card-issuing as-a-service has become mainstream: any company can now start their own card business in a matter of weeks. Last year, the number of new payment cards issued was at an all-time high. For users, however, switching banks or opening a new card now comes with an additional hurdle: they need to update their payment info across the internet. On the other side of that equation, card issuers have no visibility or control over the card-on-file updating process, and as a result struggle to get their new users to switch their spend from their old card to the new one, leading to low conversion rates and missed revenue opportunities.

Until Sunlight.

With our universal get-your-card-on-file API, FIs can now offer their users, at any point in their journey, a quick and easy way to update their debit/credit card info everywhere they shop or pay online, without ever leaving their Apps.

As mRNA technology matures, it becomes imperative that these issues are solved so we can fully explore mRNA's endless possibilities as a therapeutic.

Cisterna uses proprietary technologies to either remove a contaminant at its source or replace the source itself. For example, to remove double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), we use ribozymes - molecular scissors - to precisely cut the mRNA at its 3’ end. This assures not only 3’ homogeneity, but also eliminates dsRNA, which are primarily produced due to self-templated additions at the 3’ end. Utilizing a PCR-like system to amplify the DNA template in large quantities eliminates the requirement for plasmid enrichment in bacteria, the prime source of endotoxin contamination. These are just a few examples of Cisterna’s powerful technologies being used to achieve our goal of 10x higher quality mRNA for therapeutic application.",S22,Active,Synthetic Biology,Biotech,Therapeutics,,"San Diego, CA",US,2022,1,Hari Bhaskaran,,2,http://www.cisternabx.com,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/cisterna-biologics/,,,,,,

25928,Attain,One-Stop Shop for Convenience Store Inventory,"Attain is a one-stop shop for convenience store owners to buy inventory across all their suppliers with higher reliability, price transparency, and product discovery.

On average, store owners buy products from over 10-15 different suppliers each week. This painful process involves shopping in massive warehouses or spending hours working with wholesaler’s sales representatives (who sometimes don’t even show up). As a result, stores waste countless hours ordering products through extremely inefficient and tedious processes. These store owners are also severely impacted by inventory shortages and revenue loss which many times results in them downsizing their business or shutting them down completely.

Attain solves this problem by providing a single app to purchase products across all of their suppliers, resulting in a one-stop shop for inventory. By aggregating inventory across a multitude of suppliers and wholesalers, Attain helps stores save significant time and money while allowing them to focus on what they do best - growing their businesses.

Yet, the web was built for solo voyages. We saw a shift when platforms like Figma and Google Docs brought a multiplayer approach, breaking down walls and inspiring seamless teamwork.

At Velt, we're taking it further. We're on a mission to infuse the magic of collaboration into the fabric of the web—one app at a time. We aim to erase the lines between online and offline co-working, crafting an environment where distance is irrelevant, and 'flow' is the norm.

Right now, more than half of work hours are spent on coordination and communication—less on creating. With Velt, we're setting out to reverse these figures, reducing time spent on logistical issues by over 90%. Imagine what we can create when we spend less time talking about work and more time doing it!

- Velt SDK (https://velt.dev/): JS SDK to add powerful collaboration experiences to your own product for your end-users. This helps you ship such experiences ridiculously fast, increase user growth and engagement.

We abstract away the complexities of operating a distribution business in a foreign country – and help brands sell locally without a single employee on the ground. 

Power to the Brand is founded by Daniel Chua and Rasmus Chow, who are deeply connected in Southeast Asia, and have previously built a successful multi-brand retail and corporate gifts business.

Radiology data, such as CT and X-ray scans, is an incredibly important source of truth in healthcare delivery. In fact, over 90% of all healthcare data is medical imagery! However, the global radiology workforce is overburdened. In the UK, for example, only 2% of radiology departments are able to fulfill their reporting requirements, and this trend is reflected worldwide.

The acute state of radiology, coupled with the abundance of data, makes the use of AI in radiology a prime candidate. In 2022, $5.6 billion was invested in the development of AI in healthcare! However, a key hindrance to further adoption is the lack of sophisticated tools to build and deploy AI algorithms in clinical environments. This is the problem we’re focused on at RedBrick AI.

The exact security scheme applied to data is defined by policies that align with an organization’s existing InfoSec program.

JumpWire helps companies who maintain information security with compliance programs such as SOC or HIPAA. They are processing sensitive data, often from their own customers, and exceed security best practices as a competitive advantage. JumpWire provides defense at depth to data and sits alongside access controls and Layer 4 encryption to provide a comprehensive data security solution.

JumpWire is unique from solutions such as data vaults by installing inside our customers’ own infrastructure and clouds. It is interoperable with existing applications and databases, which eliminates the need for large data migrations or code refactoring. Lower-level approaches to data security, such as encryption at rest, are too blunt and lack the ability to differentiate between properties in the data itself.

Brandon and Mina both have engineering degrees, and are building Flightcontrol to solve those same problems we personally experienced as consultants.

We discovered AWS is built for low-level developers who want maximum performance and control, and Heroku was built as an easy solution for developers who didn’t need that control. 15 years later, there’s now a large segment of developers who do want maximum performance and control but without the difficulty of AWS.

Flightcontrol solves this by providing a layer on top of AWS that makes it very easy to use and let’s them pop the hood leverage the raw power of AWS. Because of this new approach, users have migrated their production apps to Flightcontrol from Heroku, Render, Vercel, and existing AWS setups they previously spent weeks building.

24839,Talentdrop,Your personal hiring page.,"When it comes to hiring, there are lots of resources to help managers get more candidates. But on average, only 1 in every 300 of these candidates actually get hired. Hiring managers and recruiters end up taking a robotic, brute force approach to sourcing - the kind of approach top talent hates.

Managers are increasingly finding that the simplest and most personable way to attract talent starts with their network. The best candidates want to work for great people, not faceless companies. Sharing open roles on places like LinkedIn, Slack, and Twitter unlocks enormous potential for a personalized recruiting approach across a curated talent pool, but these referrals are difficult to track across platforms and end up lost in the shuffle. We are changing that.

In Southeast Asia, the education system is competitive and exam-oriented. 

There is a huge demand for interventions (tutors, workbooks, and extra classes) to help students perform better in school. Pandai fills the demand with a solution that is better than the alternatives.

👨‍🏫 Who We Are

The three founders are based in Malaysia and have known each other since high school, 23 years ago. 

After we graduated (from MIT & other US colleges), we started our first education company in 2007, focusing on coaching school students in STEM subjects.

We worked closely with students (many of them from underprivileged backgrounds) and saw firsthand the impact we’ve had on them. 

We then realized that with technology, we could reach more students and bring more impact. Hence, we released Pandai in 2020. 

🚀 Present & Future

Currently, we have launched in our home ground Malaysia in 2020. 

So far, 280,000 students have completed 83 million questions on Pandai, and 92% of users have seen some improvement in their academic performance.

24549,Ancana,Marketplace to buy managed vacation homes through fractional ownership,"With Ancana, you can own a 1/4 or 1/8 share of the home and split expenses with the other co-owners. If you buy a 1/4 share of a home, you have access to it for 3 months of the year. For each property we set up the investment trust, find qualified co-owners, and handle the entire real estate purchase transaction. Costs are split amongst the co-owners, and we take care of the furnishing and ongoing property management.

We accomplish this by creating an investment trust for each property and dividing it into individual, purchasable shares that represent ownership in the property. We furnish each home and find and vet the co-owners. Once all of the shares of the property are sold, we retain no ownership stake in the property and transition into the role of property manager, ensuring the home is well maintained and handling any issues that arise. Unlike a timeshare, Ancana owners own a real asset (the property) versus a block of time. If you decide you want to sell your share, you are free to do so at any time, either through us or on the open market, and capture any appreciation the property has accrued.",S21,Active,Marketplace,Travel,Proptech,,"Mérida, Mexico",MX,2019,2,Andres Barrios,Ryan Black,7,https://www.ancana.co,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ancana,https://www.linkedin.com/company/ancana/,,,,,,

At Protex AI, we’re on a mission to protect the industrial workforce! We’re building a proactive computer vision tool for workplace safety - empowering industrial Health and Safety (HS) teams to identify risk and danger before it becomes a problem.

🤕 The Problem:
Keeping people safe at work is extremely hard. In the U.S. alone, there were over 5,000 deaths in the workplace in 2019, mainly in the heavy industry space.

Serious workplace injuries cost U.S. businesses circa $62 Billion annually. Until now, safety has been reactive, someone has to get injured, and in some cases fatally before something is done about it.

✅ Problem Solved:
Protex AI’s platform uses privacy-preserving camera monitoring software to provide companies with an always-on guardian angel, protecting their workforce.

The platform plugs into existing CCTV infrastructure and enables HS teams to flexibly translate their document-based safety rules into the real world.

Protex AI takes these rules and autonomously audits the customer’s facility to identify areas of high risk and non-compliance.

HS teams can access this data via a reporting engine and use it in weekly safety meetings, external safety audits, insurance discussions, and legal claims.

This is a massive problem especially in places where most people don't know how to effectively use self-service mediums (or are too busy to use them).
 
We bootstrapped the company and we are profitable. As of August 2021 we have $97K in monthly revenue from 15 clients with a CMRG of 20% in the last year. We have 100% logo retention and we grow with our clients. We are currently coordinating over 600,000 medical appointments every month, just in Chile.

This problem represents a $3.5B market opportunity in Latin America only. Latin America has 650M people, each one having an average of 3 medical consultations per year. We charge for every time we effectively communicate with a patient. We plan to handle several coordination interactions with every patient for each consultation, which considers a roadmap of scheduling, confirming, booking, reimbursements, payments, among others.

We are a team mixing strong knowledge about the healthcare industry with deep technical skills. Felipe (CEO) is a former dentist that has led deep changes in healthcare payments in Chile. Mauricio (CTO) and Jorge (R&D), both PhD in Computer Science, led the creation of the most advanced Spanish Language Neural Network used daily by scientists and practitioners in LatAm (BETO: Spanish BERT).

In a weekend project, Mauricio and Jorge automated the communication with students attending a summer school obtaining impressive engagement. Felipe was struggling with contacting his patients to coordinate appointments, and saw a big opportunity in this technology. The three together have designed and run a solution that as of 2021 is coordinating over 600,000 patients per month in their home country, Chile.",S21,Active,Machine Learning,Consumer Health Services,B2B,NLP,"Santiago, Chile",CL,2017,3,Felipe Rodríguez,Mauricio Quezada,10,https://cero.ai,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/ceroai/,,Jorge Pérez,,,,

Unlike Rent the Runway, we don’t handle any inventory or deal with cleaning the items. Our initial target market is sorority girls who can have up to 3-4 events per week that they need a new outfit/dress for. One of our core theses is that this idea couldn’t have existed at scale until now because resale apps like Depop & Poshmark paved the way for a P2P model to work after familiarizing users with the process of taking pictures of items, shipping, etc. 

Advantages to our P2P model

- Entrepreneur-led
    - Similar to Depop, most of our growth will be spearheaded by a group of “top renters”
- More variety in inventory
    - Existing rental companies like Rent the Runway own all the inventory so they're limited to the brands they buy/partner with. Since we're P2P, our users can rent any item or brand that's in someone else's closet
- Better margins
    - we don’t touch any inventory or deal with the cleaning of any items
    - Unlike Rent the Runway, we don’t handle any inventory or the cleaning of items. This means people renting out their clothing on Dressd are responsible for shipping things out & returning them in good condition

1. Lightning Fast
We are on a mission to improve loading times for eCommerce users, especially on mobile devices. We want to make sure, that every site using Vue Storefront will load in under 2 seconds for all users across the globe. Currently, it is their weak spot:  
a) It takes, on average, 15.3 seconds to fully load a mobile page. 
b) 75% of mobile sites take longer than 10 seconds to load.  
c) 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load. 

Loading times mean better User Experience and this leads to eCommerce users buying more, giving better conversion rates:  
a) Walmart found that for every 1-second improvement in page load time, conversions increased by 2%  
b) Increase of conversion % at each stage of the Customer Buying Journey at eCommerce based on 0.1s improvement based on Google Research (https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/future-of marketing/creativity/mobile-page-speed-data/) 

2. Fast Time To Value
Vue Storefront is the glue for headless commerce,  giving merchants the ability to connect with any eCommerce backend, any CMS, or any other 3rd party service, as we provide those APIs by default in our cloud platform.  This is saving our clients thousands of development hours. 

Also, because of the Progressive Web App features that we provide, there is no need to build native iOS or Android apps - everything is available through the web. In combination with frontend components provided out of the box, it is possible to build a new eCommerce frontend within weeks, not months. 

3. Fast content adjustments  with any Headless CMS
Headless CMS is the only way to embrace omnichannel sales, and we know it. That is why the Enterprise version of Vue Storefront delivers the API-first setup of integrations with the best Headless CMSes out-of-the-box. 

It allows business users to edit the content & publish with a no-code approach

4. Fast learning curve for developers  
We use the modern tech stack that is easily adaptable by the developer community, and what is better market proof than the popularity of our Open Source Project? We are currently the 5th most popular eCommerce framework globally and the 1st Frontend eCommerce Framework globally!

22707,Wyndly,Life's better without allergies,"### What is Wyndly?

[Wyndly (YC W21)](https://www.wyndly.com) fixes allergies by training patients' bodies to ignore their allergy triggers. Frustrated allergy suffers come to us when they no longer want to deal with pills and sprays. We diagnose the patient’s unique allergy profile and create a personalized treatment plan to give the patient lifelong allergy relief. Specifically, Wyndly is increasing access to  sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for allergy care. For our patients, we're combining the convenience of telehealth and direct-to-consumer care with an exceptional patient experience that never loses the context of care.

Wyndly represents an opportunity to change allergy care forever. With 60 million Americans suffering from allergies today, and with this number doubling over the coming years, there's simply an incredible need for the convenient care Wyndly provides. 

You can read more about us in [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/wyndly-aims-to-bring-allergy-drops-to-the-masses/).

### The Wyndly Model 

At Wyndly, we believe that better connections lead to better care, and we’re committed to making both happen at every step of the patient journey. Our allergy practice allows our patients to work with expert providers to develop personalized treatment plans for long-term allergy relief using clinically proven therapies. From a patient’s initial consultation to their final treatment delivery, we want the Wyndly experience to be a breath of fresh air for allergy sufferers – truly effective allergy relief, simply and efficiently delivered.

Once we've conquered allergies, we're transforming the care model for every chronic condition. While transactional care for purchasing pills has flourished in telehealth, no one has gone after chronic care. Patients with chronic conditions are shuffled between providers, insurance, and more -- and they never feel heard. These patients deserve better, and we're going to give it to them. Wyndly is starting with allergies, but we'll expand into asthma, sleep apnea, and other conditions in the near future.

### Our values

**Compassion**: We approach all our patients and partners with an open mind and a genuine desire to be of service.

**Focus**: We do a few things very well, and are always clear about our boundaries and direction of travel.

**Courage**: We embrace ambiguity and discomfort because we know that’s how we grow.

**Progress**: We make something better every single day.

*It boils down to empathy and forward momentum in everything we do.*

### The team

Wyndly is proudly backed by Y Combinator and a leading group of angel investors and VCs.

While there have been developments in new psychiatric medications since the first FDA approval in 1954, today there is a growing movement among clinicians, patients, and researchers who are recognizing the need to accelerate new science.

The Osmind treatment platform is the first and only solution that solves specific challenges faced by neuropsychiatric clinics, spanning general psychiatry and interventional psychiatry (transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine, SPRAVATO®, psychedelic medicine, electroconvulsive therapy). The core electronic health record (EHR) technology is precisely developed for interventional treatment workflows and designed to support a strong therapeutic alliance, including journaling tools and assistance with health plan reimbursement, which is a significant access hurdle for millions of patients.

Research from our platform is already helping to set new standards for mental health interventions. For example, in the largest published real-world analysis of ketamine infusion therapy for depression, we teamed up with Stanford University School of Medicine to share findings in the Journal of Affective Disorders (March 2022). We have multiple ongoing research studies leveraging our proprietary real-world data, including an even larger ketamine analysis leveraging machine learning to predict treatment outcomes.

22196,"MedPiper Technologies, Inc",Enabling insurers with medical underwriting suite,"MedPiper is on a mission to build modern healthcare infrastructure to deliver personalized care and improve health outcomes.

Our Philosophy:

1. Hyper-personalisation is the future.
2. User experience in healthcare is flawed.
3. Service providers (not just doctors) should care about health outcomes. 

We believe there are two kinds of industries that are ripe for disruption: the first is where there is an opportunity to reform, it's not user-friendly, and there is a distinct lack of trust. The second is where there are a lot of uneven profit margins being distributed, where a few companies are making a lot of money, they have high-profit margins and yet, customers are unhappy.

Healthcare in India, unfortunately, belongs to both of these buckets. And this is the reason why there are many new venture-funded companies trying to bring reform to this sector using various attack vectors.

There are three reasons why we feel healthcare in India is ripe for disruption:

1. Size: Over 200B is lost in income every year because of NCD-related loss in productivity.
2. Efficiency: The industry is inefficient and has built-in redundancies.
3. Experience: Other industries have become responsive and consumer-focused (Retail>E-Commerce) whereas healthcare has always lagged behind.

The way healthcare is being delivered is changing, with patients treated less often in hospitals and more as outpatients, while payers are moving towards a system that reimburses providers for helping reduce the cost of care overall.

At Medpiper, we are working with insurance companies to build a platform where end users can access healthcare goods and services and meaningfully connect with the local brick-and-mortar healthcare vendors by being a one-stop shop for everything from telehealth and diagnostics, chronic disease management to medical devices and actual drug supplies.

If you’re looking for meaningful, rewarding experience, there are many reasons to consider joining Ready for your next chapter, including:
* **Constant engagement**: large product surface area means there’s never a shortage of interesting, challenging, meaningful problems to solve.
* Team motto is “**builders building**”: We strongly prefer shipping results to customers over heavy processes and lots of meetings.
* Experienced founders and a culture of sharing mean there are plenty of opportunities to **learn all about building startups**, not just coding.
* Aspects of the product are customer-facing enterprise tools, other aspects face the subscriber, a rare combo of **B2B** and **B2B2C**.
* **Remote team**: work anywhere you want, as long as you get strong internet (and the platform we’re making helps make that true in more places).
* We’re well funded, and place strong emphasis on **revenue from customers** – our ambition is to build a large and important company with many options down the road and **minimal dilution** along the way.

21811,Hypermile,Driver co-pilot to make trucking more efficient,"Hypermile is on a mission to improve trucking efficiency, sustainability and safety by developing an AI driver assistance system 🚛 🌎🌱.

Today, fuel is the main cost component for logistics operators, accounting for >1/3 of all operating costs. Driving behavior is a key factor affecting overall fuel consumption and can increase fuel use by up to 35%. However, current solutions are not cost effective, so logistics operators are constantly looking for new solutions. 

In addition, logistics operators are under huge sustainability pressure, as Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) are responsible for 16% of the UK's transport emissions but only 5% of the miles travelled. While electric vehicle sales for passenger vehicles are on the rise, the same can't be said for long-haul HGVs due to high initial cost and limited range, making it impractical for logistic purposes. 

With this problem in mind, we aim to leverage the latest AI techniques to improve the fuel efficiency of diesel trucks today, and increase the range of zero-emission trucks of the future. 

Our product Hypermile Co-Pilot is a retrofittable AI cruise control for commercial vehicles focused on controlling the speed of the truck efficiently. We have trained the AI algorithms to learn the best techniques for saving fuel: anticipating how traffic flow will change, optimising speed based on the road gradient and maximizing vehicle coasting. As a result, we can reduce diesel consumption by 11% and extend the range of battery-electric vehicles by 15%. The long term vision is to incrementally build higher levels of autonomy with the next milestone being a Level-3 autonomous trucking solution. 

The company was founded in May 2020 and raised a $1.5M pre-seed round in May 2021 from Y Combinator, Greg Brockman (CTO of OpenAI), Luc Vincent (former Executive VP of Autonomous Driving at Lyft Level 5) and others. We’ve received a number of R&D grants from Innovate UK, Department for Transport and Horizons 2020. We’re currently a team of 10 across Commercial, Product and Engineering (including 4. sub-teams cloud software, machine learning, automotive software and electronics).

Corporate IT and security teams are left asking questions like:
- How will I know if someone shares a sensitive Google Doc publicly?
- What if one of our employees doesn't have two-factor authentication enabled in Zoom?
- Will I know when a new user is added to Slack?
- What happens if our Salesforce minimum password setting isn't strong enough?

With Vectrix's easy-to-use SaaS security scanning, organizations everywhere can quickly identify security issues and risks like these across their entire suite of SaaS apps, including Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Slack, Zoom, GitHub, and more.

When new issues arise, IT and security teams can be alerted in real-time so that further action can be taken right away.

Founded by former security professionals from Autodesk, Vimeo, and PlanGrid, Vectrix is committed to providing teams of all sizes an efficient and reliable way to stay secure in the public cloud.

We offer online doctor’s visits, withdrawal medication prescriptions, and support for long-term recovery, using a protocol 6x more effective than most rehabs (2/3rds of which don't have doctors).

More than 3 million Americans are addicted to opioids, but 80% are not getting help, due to jobs, families, and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, there's a proven treatment that increases survival rates by 600%, and it's low cost, discreet, and convenient. It's called MAT, and it looks like treatment for anxiety or depression: medication plus therapy. However, doctors need a special waiver to prescribe the medication, which fewer than 5% of them have, so it's difficult to get, and most people are buying it on the street. Sadly, drug dealers aren't doctors: every 11 minutes another American dies of an opioid overdose, now the #1 cause of death for Americans under 50.

Ophelia is replacing rehab with telemedicine, using proven science and a consumer-first approach. The opioid treatment market in the U.S. is $15B, and 85% of opioid addicts have insurance that pays for it. We're treating roughly 400 patients with thousands more waiting.

We created a brand new asset class in Asia - offering flexible repayment options, such as tieing repayment with sales. Business owners LOVE this.

As we collect continuous data, we are able to offer better financial and technology solutions, while mitigating our downside risk.

Obesity and type 2 diabetes have reached epidemic proportions. There are 2.2B overweight people and 500M people with type 2 diabetes worldwide, and these numbers increase drastically every year. Existing drugs are not effective enough to reverse the trend. Our drug can solve this problem, because it addresses the root cause of metabolic disorders – the imbalance between caloric intake and expenditure.

Our drug will target mitochondria – the powerhouse of the cell – to generate heat. This approach has been proven to fully reverse obesity and type 2 diabetes in animals. However, therapeutic application for humans was impossible, because mitochondrial heat production could only be induced by highly artificial methods with side effects. This changed after our recent breakthrough discovery of the protein that mitochondria naturally use to generate heat. We have developed a unique high-throughput drug discovery platform to identify compounds that selectively activate this target protein, without side effects.

The program is delivered remotely over the phone and through the mobile app, therefore users are able to follow the lifestyle program from the convenience of their home. Our online program is 3X more effective at 1/4th the cost.

The user receives bi-weekly 1-1 coaching focused on behavioral changes, online community for support and motivation, and a mobile app that provides educational lessons, lifestyle tracking tools and weekly challenges (gamification). The content and behavioral change techniques are centred around healthy diet, fitness, lifestyle and stress reduction.

Our unique coaching methodology employs cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), goal-oriented treatment and self-efficacy enhancement. The coach helps the user bust negative emotions of past failures in weight-loss and increase motivation by linking short-term achievable goals with the user's personal values. Through the program, the user is able to self-identify triggers of unhealthy habit adoption and make better decisions.

Breathe Well-being has demonstrated success in helping people lose weight, build long-term healthy habits and reduce/eliminate medication for lifestyle diseases (example - Type 2 Diabetes).

We launched with money market funds and have ~40,000 customers who’ve invested (~40% MoM growth). The pandemic spurred interest among new investors, and our AUM has grown 3x since April 2020. And we’ve done this with a cost of acquisition that is 10% of the industry average. 

Here’s the problem we see. Only 10% of the 100 million middle-income Indian workers have invested in the markets. This is despite the fact that they save ~30% of their income, making this a $325B potential market in assets under management. 

However, current investment apps in India are built for active investors. With over 16,000+ mutual funds and 5000+ stocks to choose from, they are far too complicated for beginners, who make up most of the market.

We’re building an AI - driven investment planning software that is designed for beginners. Users use our conversational AI to get diversified mutual fund portfolios tailored to their goals. We also offer users a credit card secured by their investments, so they can earn return without losing liquidity.

In terms of business model, we make commissions on the asset we manage, and interchange fees on the fund.

400M millennials in India don't invest because they don't have enough time, knowledge or access to large capital. With Spenny, they just connect the card and invest every time they spend.

We're growing 67% WoW since launch, with 3,000+ users and $15,000 in AUM. Indians put $500Bn into their bank accounts annually. We charge 1.75% of the AUM for investments. That's a direct ~$9Bn market in India alone.

Potentially every time a user makes a transaction, we make money. And in that sense, the timing for Spenny couldn't have been better: 1 Trillion+ transactions are expected in 2021 because of factors like Whatsapp launching its P2P payments in India for its 400M users. And the emergence of UPI means every Indian has a virtual bank account now. 

More interesting revenue models develop from the transaction data insights of our users. We analyse the rich data to A) up-sell more financial products like insurance etc., and B) create brand loyalty programs & partnerships.

We acquire customers at minimal CAC by bank partnerships. We leverage the banks' existing users, by integrating with their mobile app. In turn, we invest into their mutual funds.

13215,Fair Square,"Bringing delight, health, and financial security to people over 65","In 1935 the Social Security Act set the retirement age to 65. At the time, the average life expectancy of an American was 62. 

A lot has changed in the last 83 years. The average American now lives until 79. The people turning 65 today were 45 during the first dot-com boom. The fastest growing segment on Tik-Tok is seniors. It took 20 years, but the internet has finally arrived for seniors.

But most of the products that seniors use are distinctly “pre-web” - they’re cumbersome and exploitative.

When seniors buy healthcare, they have to talk to an insurance agent over the phone. These agents are exactly what you’d expect - they don’t know much about health insurance and they push Mom and Dad into the plan they get the highest commission on.

When seniors look to for liquidity, reverse mortgage brokers take advantage of their financial illiteracy.

When seniors look for companionship, they find themselves isolated in the suburbs they originally moved to to raise a family.

We are acutely aware of these problems because we see our own parents experience them. 

Fair Square is fixing them. 

Fair Square’s goal is to be a company seniors trust. To advise them on health insurance and financial planning. To find them a book club or an Art History lecture at a local community college. To have the customer experience of a five-star hotel and the care and respect of a relative.

We started by building a customer obsessed health insurance brokerage for seniors. We’ve worked with 10,000 people across the United States. Our NPS score is 98, compared to an industry average of 13.

We write software that understands the activity of individual cells as opposed to all cells. This approach is novel because we are no longer looking at average signals and can be precise. It is like a police person trying to identify the speeding car, they won’t find it if they look at all the cars at once, rather they need to look at the speed of each individual car. This is the beauty of single cell genomics, we can now identify that speeding car.

Why now?
The biggest barrier for entry into the single cell genomics market are cost and data analysis. To that end, we have reduced the cost by 10-fold and built the computational infrastructure for scalability. Although single cell sequencing has only been around for about five years, we come from one of the top single cell genomics labs and were the first to process and analyze millions of immune cells. Thanks to our software solutions, we have been able to bring big data solutions to the immune system.

Where are we and where are we going?
We have generated a database of over 1 million immune cells spanning healthy, cancerous, and autoimmune immune cells and are growing through paid partnerships. Harnessing out database and ML software, we can take a data-centric approach for better target discovery. Fortunately, as our database continues to grow, our models will continue to learn for more precise, unbiased, and automated single cell genomics.

Volumetric is a recognized world leader in building living multicellular tissues, with a focus on replicating discrete functions of the human body for basic mechanistic biology, laboratory testing and screening, and drug development. Founded in 2018 by Bagrat Grigoryan and Jordan Miller as a spin-out from Rice University, the full potential of our work is to build whole human organ replacements for patients, made from their own cells.

Our Technology and Approach
We have invented a suite of breakthrough 3D bioprinting technologies, featured on the cover of Science, that can build human tissue with complex blood vessel networks. We are leveraging this technology in the short term to build patient-specific tissues for drug safety and efficacy testing.

We are building a complete digital health hub for future fathers/parents. We aim to change the outdated view that fertility is a ""women's issue"" by creating an accessible, affordable product for men & people with sperm. This includes everything from a mail-in kit for sperm testing & sperm freezing, personalized sperm improvement products, tele-health, DNA fragmentation analysis, supplements, and more.

**Why are we the leader?** 

The company was founded at Harvard by a team of healthcare and fertility experts. We obsess about talent density and have out-executed our competitors over the past few years. Beyond our D2C channel, we've also unlocked:

1. Insurance (We cover over 10M individuals through insurance in NY and CA)
2. Military (We serve the Navy SEALs & other SpecOps through exclusive programs)
3. Employers (We work with the top fertility benefit providers like Progyny, Carrot, and Maven)

**Tell me about the team** 

We're a team of under 50, extremely diverse (majority female, majority immigrants, strong LGBQTIA+ representation, age range of 25-65), and very values driven. Our 5 values are customer centricity, reliability, kindness, openness, and winning.

Dex helps turn your acquaintances into your allies.  Going beyond the superficiality of social networks requires commitment.  If you remember to keep in touch thoughtfully, you can turn the interesting person you met at a networking event into a friend that has your back.  

I built Dex after failing to keep up with the tools I tried (Airtable, Notion, etc) for relationship management. Installing an actual CRM like Hubspot felt like a wrong fit for my informal relationships -- these people were 'my team,' not customers.

Dex is a lightweight personal CRM that’s easy to stick with. Key to Dex is a Chrome extension that enables you to manage relationships while you’re in Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, and the social apps you already use. Dex can also send you actionable reminders (daily, or based on your calendar events) to log your interactions for next time. By using Dex, you can:

- Build stronger relationships, by sending you a nudge to follow-up.
- Be more thoughtful, by helping you remember where you left off.
- Become a superconnector, by making connections you wouldn’t otherwise remember.

12728,MyPetrolPump,On demand fuel delivery service in India,"Why did we pick this idea to work on? 
India is a country with 200 mln vehicles (about the same number as USA) but one third the number of gas stations(60K) as compare to USA(160K), The consequence of odd number of fuel stations is long queues of vehicles at the gas stations to fill up, heavily congested Indian roads make it worse. Opening of 100K new fuel stations is practically & economically impossible in urban localities due to rocketing high land prices. And that's how the idea of mobile refueling was conceptualized by founders. Literally ""bringing the gas stations to doorsteps"". The problem of buying fuel is much more alarming in large volume consumer segments such as Vehicle fleet users like schools, cab rentals, freight logistics operators , tours and travels operators, hospitals, hotels, real estate etc who burn huge amount of dead mileage & loss of productivity while sending all fleet vehicles to gas stations to fill up. Additionally, India has a unique problem of Electricity blackouts. Current avg. is less than 18 hours of a day of electricity in Indian metro cities, which causes more than 20 mln household and commercial buildings running on backup generators which require Diesel. They cant bring the generators to gas stations either therefore they buy Diesel in jerry cans or barrels and transport unsafely. Our solution is solving the desperate & daily need of Indian consumers along with convenience.

Do we have domain expertise in this area? 
Founder is ex veteran of Shell with 9 years of global experience, has complete understanding Oil marketing business.

How do you know people need what you're making? 
We have over 5000 registred large volume customers who are waiting to be served. With our limited number of refueling vehicles ,we could serve max 1200 customers currently.

Our first product is a small molecule therapeutic for stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine, of which there are no FDA approved treatments.

Our small molecule technology are atypical inhibitors of the dopamine transporter. Cocaine itself is an inhibitor of the same transporter. Directly reducing craving or positive reinforcement is a successful treatment strategy for addiction. Methadone or buprenorphine (Suboxone) are key examples of this for opioid use disorder. However, these types of medications can be addictive themselves. This has been a major hurdle for medication development for cocaine addiction and has led to many leaders in the addiction space to abandon the dopamine transporter as a target. At EncepHeal, we believe that the dopamine transporter should not be abandoned and instead focusing on fixing the abuse liability problem. Therefore with our partners at the National Institutes of Health, we have shown that these new, allosteric modulators at the dopamine transporter do not display addictive tendencies in animal models. They are also effective at curbing cocaine addiction. 

Our management team has two co-founders, Omeed Rahimi and Aaron Lazarus, as well as an experienced addiction pharmacologist as their research officer. The team has an advisory board with entrepreneurial and addiction drug development experience as well as expert partners at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a subset of the NIH, and Wake Forest.

11929,Pippin / Rent the Backyard,Autonomous homebuilding factory for the $1.7 trillion housing crisis.,"Pippin is building the autonomous homebuilding factory for the $1.7 trillion housing crisis. 

Building a home requires human labor to: measure, cut, lift, drill, paint, and attach. This labor is used for a building’s: structure, vapor barriers, windows, insulation, siding, roofing, electrical, plumbing, fixtures, appliances, and cabinetry. The construction industry solves this complex variety of tasks by dividing them among tiny companies of specialized artisans. Few lessons learned are shared and the industry has had no growth in labor productivity since 1947.

We provide…,"If it isn’t bad enough that smokers don’t realize the scientific facts about nicotine, most non-tobacco nicotine products are poorly designed and unappealing to use. The leading gum is sold like a pharmaceutical drug, with flavoring and packaging to match. Vapes provide a cumbersome, over-the-top experience — with use as tightly restricted as cigarette smoking itself, but more juvenile, conspicuous, and highly addictive. People want, and deserve, a better way.

Therefore, we want to deliver nicotine users a superior experience, and at the same time give them a way to transition out of feeling dependent. In a better society, people wouldn’t carry around the sensation that they’re stuck with an involuntary habit. Our mission isn’t to encourage nicotine use among people who haven’t started. Unlike certain vapes or other products, ours isn’t the sort coveted by underage users on social media. Our mission is to alleviate the harm related to tobacco — first and foremost, by switching people away from the most harmful products.

So, at Lucy, we take an evidence based view of nicotine. Nicotine’s pleasurable properties make it an inevitable part of modern society. Therefore, minimizing harm in all nicotine products is key, in addition to giving people products and strategies for cessation. We feel that, as 1,300 people are dying of tobacco related illnesses every day in the US, the most important and immediate step toward a better society is giving nicotine consumers products they enjoy using that will cause less harm.

Our first product is designed to appeal to smokers and encourage them to switch. And, looking ahead, we hope to secure approval in the future as a clinically proven smoking cessation aid, while continuing to participate in the FDA’s public hearings around how NRTs are best regulated. Our goals are simple: because harm reduction is a better strategy around nicotine delivery than abstinence or prohibition, we want to help improve public health — and reduce its costs — through a superior pure nicotine product.",W18,Active,3D Printed Foods,Biotech,E-commerce,,"Los Angeles, CA",US,2016,3,John Coogan,Samy Hamdouche,7,https://lucy.co/,,,,David Renteln,,,,

We do not use the standard industry models, instead using a multiperil model to more granularly price risk.  This means that for a few of you we are more expensive... but everyone else pays much less than they would otherwise pay.

Our granular, multiperil model allows us to offer a superior policy over the standard market including:

    - Replacement Cost Coverage (meaning new stuff for your old)
    - All Risk coverage for high value items you tell us about - including computers (almost no one does that amazingly)

1665,Oncobox,Finding the right cancer drug for each patient. ,"Oncobox believes that many late-stage cancer patients are dying prematurely because doctors lack a data-driven tool to help them decide which drugs currently on the market would most effectively fight individual patients’ specific cancers. That’s where Oncobox comes in. Oncobox is low-cost personalized genetic profiling to help doctors decide which drug to use. In a recent study conducted by leading cancer researchers in Europe and Asia on 900 patients with various late-stage cancers, Oncobox increased the effectiveness of targeted therapies from 25% to 64%.

How does Oncobox work? Over 150 targeted cancer drugs are currently on the market. But deciding which of these drugs to give to late-stage cancer patients is not a simple task. Cancer doctors are in a race against the clock. They don’t always know which medication will be most effective for their patients. Because these drugs are expensive and typically have significant side effects, they can’t just try them all. Because of these barriers, targeted cancer therapies are effective only 25% of the time, and 70% of patients with late-stage cancers die due to the toxic side effects of ineffective drugs.

Oncobox Dx analyses tumor DNA, RNA, and molecular pathways using algorithms to distinguish which molecular targets are the most crucial for individual cases. Doctors receive a clinically actionable report that shows them which drugs are likely to be most effective on the patient.

We actively seek partners from pharma, hospitals/clinicians, payers, and genomic centers. Feel free to contact us at hello@oncobox.com.

Once the heat pump market is mature, we will address the seasonal energy storage market. Our storage units are based on the exact same proprietary engine we use for our heat pumps. They work with solar and wind, and replace lithium-ion batteries, fossil-fired power plants, CO2 capture and storage, and fuel procurement, with a cheaper, sustainable and more reliable alternative, which can be sited anywhere.

The first opportunity is a high-margin market worth 3% of worldwide CO2. The second is a much bigger market worth 30% of worldwide CO2. By the time all cars become electric, it will be even more.

When we started Bountiful in 2015, the grape error rate for predicting production was 30 percent. Why? We found that many farmers in the specialty crops space were still using traditional pencil-and-paper techniques to predict yield. These low-fidelity forecasting methods weren’t giving them a clear enough understanding of their production until it was too late, leading to waste and inefficiency throughout the supply chain.

We saw a problem we wanted to solve.

Today, Bountiful is using advanced data science to help farmers forecast more accurately, so they can make better decisions. In the last three years, we’ve combined the latest in machine learning with weather, satellite, geographic, and historical data. The result is a user-friendly platform that transforms volumes of complex agricultural information into simple, actionable insights farmers can use to run more economically and environmentally sustainable farms.

More recently, we’re working to open the dialogue between buyers and sellers, remove uncertainty, and provide clarity to the supply chain to meet global food demand.

Our CDN works with your servers to ensure that as your viewership increases, your network gets stronger by offloading bandwidth to our peer network. On average, this has been shown to increase server capacity by 20x, offload 70% of bandwidth, increase viewing time by 30% and decrease instances of rebuffering by 40%.

1395,Freckle Education,Differentiated practice in math and literacy for K-12,"Our mission is simple: ensure every student gets a world-class education.

Every classroom has students at many different levels. In fact, close to 75% of classrooms have students with reading levels that span across more than four grade levels!

Yet, most teachers are only provided with resources that teach one specific level. To overcome this, teachers work nights and weekends to find the perfect piece of content for each of their students. Then, during the day, they work with their classes in small groups so they can personalize their instruction as best they can.

Teachers are doing this all on their own and they deserve our help.

That’s why, at Freckle, we provide teachers the resources and data they need to teach all of their students at the level that’s best for them.",IK12,Acquired,Education,SaaS,,,San Francisco,US,2013,1,Sidharth Kakkar,,52,http://www.freckle.com,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/freckle-education,,,,,,,

THE PROBLEM:

K-12 districts collect an enormous amount of student data. Educators now recognize that data can inform decisions that improve student outcomes, but few are equipped to make sense of data in a timely manner. Efforts to be “data-driven” require costly software, time-consuming setup, and extensive training. The resulting reports, which are often complex and outdated, fail to provide the information needed for daily decision-making.

That means portfolios of our lender customers stay completely liquid in the secondary market. No one else can offer that today.

Women's health has always been under-prioritized in science. We still operate in a world built by men, for men. It’s why in 2014, Dr. Sara Naseri and Søren Therkelsen started Qvin to research, develop, and patent a product that powers an underserved and understudied population—women.

However, the blood our bodies naturally deliver every month has never been explored as a testing source. And yet, menstrual blood has been left unexplored.

Qvin is the first and only healthcare service to use period blood as a non-invasive blood test. We exist to give women an easy, insightful way to monitor existing health issues, proactively screen for others, and go into doctor visits more informed and confident of their own health.

Our health technology platform helps women manage their health better through a non-invasive blood collection device named the Q-Pad™.

Yet, Chinese factories seem undifferentiated because they all make the same, unverifiable claims of excellence. 

This results in competition centered on price. Factories are forced to under-bid contracts to win business, but often, they later surprise the customer with quality problems and delays.

This process is broken. We install cameras and remote monitoring software on the assembly line, and this ensures compliance with test protocol, improves quality, reduces liability, and helps fight warranty fraud.

We charge a nominal per-unit fee to the OEM and revenue share with the factory when they demonstrate compliance with quality standards (whether units pass or fail).

It encourages better behavior from factories and rewards those who perform with an audit trail of good performance that helps them win new foreign business.

827,Razorpay,India's leading financial platform for all things payments & banking…,"The journey of building the ecosystem from scratch started in 2014, when Harshil Mathur (CEO & Co-Founder) and Shashank Kumar (MD & Co-Founder)  were working on a crowdfunding portal project for India, they soon realized that most of the online payment gateway solutions were extremely cumbersome to get started on, especially for startups and SMEs. The company was surprised to see that the simple process of accepting payments was not streamlined. So they went about building an ecosystem from scratch with a hyperfocus on making the lives of businesses simpler and that's how Razorpay was born. The company witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve - democratizing payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, the SMEs. Razorpay today powers online payments for 34 of the 42 startups in India that became unicorns in 2022. 

Razorpay enables payments and banking solutions for over 10Mn businesses, including the likes of Facebook, Airtel, Lenskart, Mirae Asset Capital markets, Indian Oil, National Pension Scheme, TataConsultancy Services, Swiggy, CRED, BookMyShow, Ola, Zomato, Swiggy, ICICI Prudential among others. The core premise of the vision and values that Razorpay was founded in 2014 is the same as the organization practices today. It is to make money movement simpler and easier. Razorpay is on the path of building the Central Nervous System of Digital India, the next-gen payments and banking infrastructure for Digital India. The company will continue building an ecosystem that will not just build intelligent products that will make the lives of businesses easy and efficient but also drive financial growth and innovation for small businesses. All this is being done, together, in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for doing business.

Razorpay’s valuation jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion in just 14 month in 2021 and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley’s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company’s valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. Razorpay plans to further scale up its Business Banking Suite, RazorpayX, and again build new banking solutions in 2023 that will help businesses focus less on handling compliance, operations and more on growth.

This commitment to make lives simpler will continue at a much deeper level now, thanks to the opportunity to make acquisitions with like-minded companies.  In total, till date, Razorpay has made seven acquisitions over the course of time: 

Acquired Ezetap in 2022 - India’s leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India’s leading fintech startup that provides payments-linked loyalty solutions to payment networks, banks, and businesses, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A Recurring revenue platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions.  RazorpayX Payroll in 2019 - a Payroll and HR Management Software company, to solve for seamless automation of a business’s entire payroll process, and Thirdwatch in 2019 - an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven company specializing in big data and machine learning for real-time fraud prevention. 

Customer has always been at the core of all disruption that the company does, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions:

- This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay’s several Industry first innovation into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automating payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include:

- First to launch India’s Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ 
- Razorpay became India’s first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI
- Razorpay also became India’s largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India’s leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience. 
- Razorpay expanded health insurance policy to include LGBTQIA+ and Live-In Partners- This industry-first move made Razorpay the first Fintech unicorn in India to introduce a thoughtfully diverse and highly inclusive insurance policy for its team members. The new insurance policy, introduced recently, is applicable to all current team members of Razorpay.

Nearly 3 out of 4 millennials would rather go to the dentist than listen to their bank. While it's possible that we just really love our oral hygiene, it's more likely that we don't trust or like our banks.

It's not hard to understand why. Big banks use big budgets and armies of salespeople and marketers to sell old-school products layered with fees and penalties. Their profits increase when we spend more, overuse debt, and make mistakes like overdrafting.

Big banks get away with this because banking is such a vital service. Everyday spending and saving decisions that begin at the checking account ultimately determine whether we'll lead a healthy and secure financial life.

So it's a win-win deal : For businesses downtime is minimized, and for DevOps engineers they need not worry about a deluge of alerts and midnight wake up calls.

The business demands on web visual media can blindside even the most hyper-aware content teams and developers. Just to be competitive on the Internet, you need your images to be sized perfectly to every device, served in one of any of a half dozen web formats, optimized to the absolute best perceptual quality while maintaining pinpoint performance, and distributed to wherever your users are, anywhere in the world. And that is just the baseline. Next-level imaging concerns like copyright, licensing, accessibility, moderation, illegal or explicit content, ""fake news"", and more, can threaten your business at any moment if not handled properly. Get any of these things wrong and you are shedding revenue, ceding ground to competitors, and potentially exposing your business to extreme liability.

By working with imgix's powerful APIs, SDKs, user interfaces, and integrations, you can rest assured that any demands on your images and videos will always be met, now and into the future, without you having to invest in building it yourself or patching together a mishmash of open source and third-party technologies. Our platform is designed to ensure that your images are always working for your business and never against it.

Give a young child a couple of toys or a box of crayons and he or she is likely to play for hours, deeply engrossed in an imaginary world. In both art and dramatic play, children construct settings, create fictional characters, and act out fantastic storylines that would be the envy of many Hollywood scriptwriters. Yet, ask that same child to write out a story in a blank notebook or a word processor and you would be lucky to capture a fraction of the depth and splendor of his or her imagination. Play inspires and scaffolds the creative process from an early age, but there is a persistent gap between the origins of imaginative play (ages 4-5) and kids' adoption of the formal discipline of creative writing (ages 8-10).

At Launchpad Toys, we're using mobile devices like the iPad to bridge this gap between informal and formal learning, to harness the power of play to help children capture and share their ideas with other kids around the world.

Soon one app become four, and before we knew it we had lots of happy users and lots of great coverage by all sorts of people such The Telegraph, Wired, O'Reilly and MacFormat. Being a friendly bunch, we took the time to chat with the hundreds of you who said hello, and we found you all had the same problem: gyms were either too expensive, too daunting, too boring or too inconvenient. In other words, a lot of people needed another way to stay active.

And the more people we spoke to, the bigger this problem seemed to be - it was like almost no one was active enough! Big problems require big solutions, so after raising some money from the visionaries at 4iP we amassed a team of the best designers, artists, 3d animators and programmers with the single mission: to improve the fu of the world by making an app so damn good that everyone will want to stay active.

* Discover a new way to stay motivated

* Stay active wherever, whenever

No more being tied to a games console or a gym, now you can stay active wherever you are - be that your bedroom, your office, a hotel room or in the cabin of your Mississippi boat. (Yes it happens!)

The homepage also features a stream of the latest comments to come in from other users, as well as a profile for each restaurant in the system that includes all of its votes and comments. There's also a nifty feature that lets you view a heatmap of your current region, so you can quickly figure out the hot spots in town.

The gameplay in GraffitiGeo gives you points for checking into certain locations, similar to FourSquare, but doesn't really let you do anything with them. With GraffitiGeo, you earn points for every action you take, be it voting on a restaurant or leaving a brief comment. Once you've reached a certain point threshold, you can use those points to start a ""mob"", which you can invite your friends to join. Mobs allow friends to pool their points, which can then be used to acquire territory, which corresponds to actual city blocks. Whenever someone votes on one of the restaurants on the block, the mob gets some street cred too.

There should not be any distractions caused by poorly designed websites, unreliable data, or unwieldy spreadsheets of haphazard electronic component information. You should be able to compare components, find important technical information, and easily grasp the spectrum of parts that will be a match for your design.

This is what Octopart strives for.

Finding electronic component information should not be holding engineers back from bringing ideas to life quickly and efficiently. We believe that pricing, availability, technical specifications, and reference designs should be transparent, fast to find, and easy to understand. That’s why we create powerful, intelligent tools that streamline the engineering workflow and enable fast decision making. Octopart provides accurate and complete data for millions of electronic components in a way that makes it easy to find and compare parts.
